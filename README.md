Cluster Tumblr Theme
==================

A decidedly effed-up Tumblr theme, first designed for a residency with the Internet Archive.
	
Randomly places && rotates (nearly) all page elements. Like && reblog buttons are not placed with their posts allowing for chance-based social interaction. Interface is click-and-drag for remixing the layout ( easier access to hidden items).
	
NOTES && CAVEATS  
+ It seems that video sizing doesn't work quite right...
+ Photosets will work, but will be a single massive stack - better to post individually
	
CUSTOM CSS && OPTIONS  
+ Insert custom CSS modifications in the Appearance editor, or after the theme CSS
	
Also included are several options for making the site more or less complex:  
+ enable custom keyboard actions (randomize, like all posts, etc)
+ option to randomize the Tumblr follow, etc controls as well
+ show/hide RSS (required for full Tumblr themes)
+ show/hide random post link
+ custom text for menu tag separators
+ customized fonts && colors, including a random mode

GOOGLE ANALYTICS  
+ doesn't seem to be working with the custom option - follow one of the many online instructions for adding it manually

REQUIRES  
+ [Font Awesome for reblog icon](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome)
+ [JQuery && JQUery UI](http://www.jquery.com)
