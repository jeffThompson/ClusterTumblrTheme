Cluster Tumblr Theme
==================

A decidedly effed-up Tumblr theme.

Randomly places and rotates (nearly) all page elements. Like and reblog buttons are not placed with their posts allowing for chance-based social interaction. Interface is click-and-drag for remixing the layout (and easier access to hidden items).
		
**NOTES && CAVEATS**
* It seems that videos don't work quite right, sorry...
* Photosets will work, but will be a massive stack - better to post individually
		
**CUSTOM CSS**
* Insert custom CSS modifications in the Appearance editor, or after the theme CSS
		
**THANK YOU**
* Custom like button via:  
http://like-button.tumblr.com
* Open Sans typeface via Google via Adobe

* Creating Tumblr pages (for some reason not in the main Tumblr docs)
